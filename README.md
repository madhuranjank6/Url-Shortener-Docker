URL Shortener

This is a simple URL shortener application built using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework. It allows users to enter long URLs and generates shorter, more manageable URLs that redirect to the original long URLs.

Features:
- Generate short URLs from long URLs
- Redirect short URLs to their corresponding long URLs
- Randomly generated short URL keys using alphanumeric characters
- Lightweight and easy to understand Flask application

Usage:
1. Enter a long URL in the provided input field
2. Click "Shorten" to generate a shortened URL
3. The shortened URL will be displayed, and you can click on it to test the redirection

How to Run:
1. Install Python and Flask dependencies
2. Clone the repository
3. Navigate to the project directory
4. Run 'python app.py' to start the Flask development server
5. Open your web browser and go to 'http://localhost:5000'

Feel free to modify and enhance the application as per your requirements. Contributions are welcome!

Note: This is a basic implementation for learning purposes. In a production environment, additional features such as validation, custom URL slugs, and persistent storage should be considered.
